# Step Update Android SDK

Need to install or update a packge from Android SDK Manager? Use this Step to
  install and update them as you wish! 
The main ideia is to provide a GUI just like the SDK Manager to configure your SDK packages.  
Packges support will be added per request.

## How to use this Step

Can be run directly with the [bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise),
just `git clone` this repository, `cd` into it's folder in your Terminal/Command Line
and call `bitrise run test`.

*Check the `bitrise.yml` file for required inputs which have to be
added to your `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file!*


## Share your own Step

You can share your Step or step version with the [bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise). Just run `bitrise share` and follow the guide it prints.
